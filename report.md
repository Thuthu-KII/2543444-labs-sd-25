I created my repository on Github, amed it 2543444-labs-sd-25, and made it public.

Then i cloned the repository to my local machine, had to create a personal access token first so i can HTTPS into it remotely.

Then now working locally i created the three files: student-info.txt, report.md, index.html.

Then i put my name and student number into the student-info file, then i set up the structure of my HTML page then i started reporting into this file everything i did so far

Then i used the command "git add ." to stage everything i have done so far

Then i used "git commit" so write(save) the current state of the repository to history

Then i ran into an error "Author identity unknowm', so i had to use the commands:  git config --global user.email "2543444@students.wits.ac.za" and git config --global user.name "Thuthu-KII"

Then after commiting i pushed the code i have so far to Github using the command "git push"

Then i created a new branch called feature/student-details and switched to it (changes in this branch wont affect the main branch)
